# Joshua Hohaia - Portfolio

Personal portfolio website designed to showcase my experience, skills, and projects as a Frontend Developer. The site features a CRT monitor aesthetic, interactive elements, and a responsive design using vanilla JS and HTML.

[**Live Preview**](https://joshuahohaia.github.io/)

## Features

*   **Retro CRT Aesthetic:** Custom CRT scanline and text-shadow effects with a user-adjustable intensity slider. Implementation uses CSS variables and repeating linear gradients to simulate a cathode-ray tube display.
*   **Theme System:** Toggle between Light and Dark modes. System preferences are detected automatically, and the choice is persisted via `localStorage`.
*   **Interactive Game:** A built-in "Jumping" game where you collect letters to spell "JOSHUA". 
    *   **Character Selection:** Choose between different emojis or pull your own GitHub avatar.
    *   **Controls:** Supports Space/Arrow keys for desktop and a dedicated touch button for mobile.
    *   **Celebration:** Features a custom confetti system triggered upon victory.
*   **Responsive ASCII Art:** Adaptive ASCII banners that switch between full, medium, and small versions based on screen width.
*   **Experience Timeline:** An expandable, data-driven timeline. Nested experience items (like contract roles) are supported, and the first item auto-expands on large screens.
*   **No Frameworks:** Built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for maximum performance and zero dependencies.

## Tech Stack

*   **HTML5:** Semantic structure and ARIA attributes for basic accessibility.
*   **CSS3:** Flexbox layout, CSS Variables (Custom Properties), and Keyframe animations.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** DOM manipulation, Game logic, and State management without external libraries.
